# Project Name

Josh's Server Side Calculator

## Description

This project is a calculator that does basic arithmetic functions. It gathers number and operator inputs from the user, sends them to the server, then retrieves the solution. Once retrieved, the data is rendered to the DOM.

Previous calculations are stored in the history. You can click on one to bring it back to the main display.

Safeguards are in place to verify good data is passed.

*** I didn't focus a lot on the css, but tried to make sure the functionality I implemented worked properly. Let me know if you find anything that breaks! ***
